# NFC Tag Holder ‚Äì Custom Client Design

This repository showcases the **custom NFC tag holder** I designed for a client project.  
The goal was to create a functional and branded holder that securely fits an NFC tag while featuring the client‚Äôs logo embossed on the top surface.

## üìå Project Description

The NFC tag holder was designed as a **keychain-style accessory** with the following features:
- **Embossed client logo** on the top face.  
- **Inner circular cavity** to hold and protect the NFC tag.  
- **Keyring extension** for daily usability.  
- Geometry optimized for **3D printing, laser cutting, or molding**.  
- **DXF file of the logo** prepared for laser cutting or engraving.  

This project highlights my ability to take a customer‚Äôs requirements and translate them into a **functional, manufacturable, and customized product design**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Workflow

1. Reviewed the client‚Äôs requirements and logo.  
2. Modeled the NFC holder in **SOLIDWORKS 2025**.  
3. Integrated the **embossed logo** into the design.  
4. Produced **2D drawings** and **DXF logo file**.  
5. Exported files for **3D printing, laser cutting, and visualization**.
