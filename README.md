# Reverse-Engineered Projects & Parts

This repository contains my collection of **reverse-engineered parts and projects** created in **SOLIDWORKS**.
Each project starts from a **2D technical drawing sourced online**, which I then use to:

* Recreate an accurate **3D CAD model**.
* Regenerate the **2D engineering drawing** based on my 3D model.
* (When applicable) Build complete **assemblies**.

---

## 📌 Purpose

* Strengthen my skills in **3D CAD modeling** and **technical drawing recreation**.
* Develop a personal library of **reverse-engineered components and assemblies**.
* Practice generating **engineering drawings** from models.
* Document my workflow and methodology as part of my learning journey.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Software

* **SOLIDWORKS** – For part, assembly, and drawing creation.
* **STEP/IGES Exports** – For compatibility and sharing.
* **Technical Drawings (sourced online)** – Used as references for reconstruction.

---

## 📖 Workflow

1. Collect **2D drawings** from publicly available references.
2. Recreate the **3D CAD model** in SOLIDWORKS.
3. **Regenerate the 2D drawing** from the 3D model, matching the original as closely as possible.
4. Export parts, assemblies, and drawings in **neutral CAD formats** for sharing.
5. Document assumptions, sources, and challenges for each project.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

* All models and drawings are created **for educational and practice purposes only**.
* Source drawings are taken from freely available references on the internet.
* No proprietary or confidential designs are included.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

* Expand with more **mechanical parts, assemblies, and detailed drawings**.
* Organize projects by **categories and complexity**.
* Explore reverse engineering from **real-world references (photos, videos, or measurements)** in addition to 2D drawings.
