# Machined Bracket Component (Exercise 4)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project showcases the reverse engineering and 3D modeling of a **machined bracket component** in **SOLIDWORKS**. The part was created from a fully dimensioned 2D exercise drawing and includes complex features such as counterbored holes, ribs, fillets, through slots, and angled faces. The goal of this project is to demonstrate precision CAD modeling and technical drawing recreation.
