# Sheet Metal Bracket – CAD Recreation

This repository contains a **CAD recreation of a sheet metal bracket**, modeled and drafted in **SOLIDWORKS** as a reverse-engineering and learning exercise. The drawing provides detailed orthographic views, a flat pattern, and a 3D view of the finished part.
