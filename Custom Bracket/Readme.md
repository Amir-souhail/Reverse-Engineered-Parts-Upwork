# Reverse-Engineered Engineering Bracket

This repository showcases a project in **reverse engineering**, where a complex part was recreated from an existing 2D technical drawing. The original drawing was sourced from the internet, and the entire model was regenerated in **SolidWorks**. This project highlights my ability to accurately interpret technical documentation and translate it into a fully parametric 3D model.

### Project Overview
The primary objective was to reverse-engineer an engineering bracket by meticulously measuring and recreating all features from a 2D drawing. This process demonstrates proficiency in **SolidWorks**, including part modeling, dimensioning, and generating manufacturing-ready drawings. The files provided are a testament to the successful execution of a reverse engineering workflow.

### Key Features
-   **Regenerated in SolidWorks:** The entire part, including its complex geometry and specific features like chamfers, radii, and hole placements, was modeled from scratch within SolidWorks. The model is fully parametric, allowing for easy modification of key dimensions.
-   **Focus on Accuracy:** Every dimension and tolerance from the source drawing was carefully replicated to ensure the new model is a precise digital twin of the original design.
-   **Complete Documentation:** The repository includes both the 3D SolidWorks part file (`.SLDPRT`) and a new 2D technical drawing (`.PDF` or `.SLDDRW`). This drawing was generated directly from the 3D model, ensuring consistency and adherence to drafting standards.
-   **Reverse Engineering Theme:** This project serves as a practical example of a reverse engineering processâ€”taking a finished product's 2D representation and building its 3D digital model for analysis, modification, or manufacturing.

### Contents
-   **SolidWorks Part File (.SLDPRT):** The fully parametric 3D model.
-   **SolidWorks Drawing File (.SLDDRW):** The native 2D drawing file.
-   **PDF Drawing (.PDF):** A universal format for viewing the detailed technical drawing.
-   **STEP/IGS File:** A generic 3D format for compatibility with other CAD software.

This project is an excellent example of my skills in technical drawing interpretation and advanced CAD modeling, specifically within the context of reverse engineering. It is an ideal portfolio piece for anyone seeking to demonstrate expertise in converting legacy or physical parts into modern digital models.
