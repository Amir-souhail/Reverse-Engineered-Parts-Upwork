# Upwork Job – CAD Drawing Recreation

This repository contains a **reverse-engineered recreation** of a part drawing originally provided in an Upwork job. The goal was to rebuild the design for **portfolio purposes**, showcasing CAD drafting, dimensioning, and technical documentation skills.

## Contents

* `Upwork Job.JPG` — Recreated technical drawing (includes orthographic views, dimensions, and isometric projection).

---

## Overview

The part features:

* A **100 × 50 mm base** with a stepped profile.
* A **Ø30 mm cylindrical feature** raised above the base.
* A **slotted cut (R10 radius)** aligned with the main axis.
* Detailed **orthographic and isometric views** for clarity.

This drawing was carefully reproduced to match the original job requirements and highlight precision in CAD documentation.

## Bill of Materials (BOM)

Although this is a **single-part design**, the drawing represents:

| Item | Part Name        | Qty | Notes                                           |
| ---- | ---------------- | --- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Base Component   | 1   | 100 × 50 mm rectangular block with step profile |
| 2    | Cylindrical Boss | 1   | Ø30 mm × 25 mm height feature on top surface    |
| 3    | Slot Cutout      | 1   | R10 radius slot, centered on top face           |

This BOM breaks the geometry into functional features rather than separate manufactured parts, reflecting how the component is designed.

## Purpose

* **Portfolio Project:** Demonstrates ability to interpret and recreate client-provided drawings.
* **Reverse Engineering Practice:** Rebuilt from reference images/specs.
* **CAD Proficiency:** Highlights 2D drafting, dimensioning, and layout presentation.
