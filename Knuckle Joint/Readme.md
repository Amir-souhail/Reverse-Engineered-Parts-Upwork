# Knuckle Joint

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains the **3D CAD model, engineering drawings, and related files** for a **Knuckle Joint**. The knuckle joint is a mechanical linkage used to connect two rods under tensile load while allowing angular movement.

The model and drawings were created in **SOLIDWORKS** and exported in multiple formats for manufacturing, visualization, and sharing.

## 🔧 Components

* **Fork (FS 1 OFF)** – double-ended link with holes for the pin
* **Eye End (FS 1 OFF)** – single-ended eye link
* **Collar (MS 1 OFF)** – locking support ring
* **Pin (MS 1 OFF)** – connecting cylindrical pin
* **Taper Pin (MS 1 OFF)** – 1:30 taper locking pin
